# Cursor AI Rules for ForeFlight Dashboard

## CRITICAL: Container-Only Operations

**ALL operations must be performed inside Docker containers. NEVER run commands directly on the host system.**

### Rules for AI Assistants:

1. **Testing**: Always use `make test` which automatically starts containers and runs tests inside them
2. **Development**: Use `make start` to run the application in containers  
3. **Database operations**: Use `docker exec` to run database commands inside containers
4. **Package management**: 
   - Python: Use `docker exec` to run pip commands inside containers
   - Node.js: Use `docker exec` to run npm commands inside containers
5. **Building**: Use `docker-compose build` or `make build`
6. **Debugging**: Use `docker logs` and `docker exec` for container inspection

### Deployment:

This application is designed for **container-only deployment** on platforms like:
- Railway.com
- DigitalOcean App Platform  
- Heroku Container Registry
- AWS ECS/Fargate
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Instances

### Never Do:
- `pip install` on host
- `npm install` on host  
- Direct Python/Node execution on host
- Database operations outside containers
- File operations outside container context

### Always Do:
- Use `make` targets which handle container orchestration
- Use `docker exec` for any container operations
- Use `docker logs` for debugging
- Keep all dependencies in Dockerfile/requirements.txt/package.json
